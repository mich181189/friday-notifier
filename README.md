# friday-notifier
Script to send text messages on fridays

# usage
Easiest way is to build the RPM. There's a COPR repo:
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/mich181189/python-twilio/
for the twilio module. 

Needs a twilio account and the config file updating, obviously.

# testing
This project contains a pylintrc file to allow for rough
regression testing of quality and stupid errors using
pylint-3
